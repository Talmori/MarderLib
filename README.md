# MarderLib

is a library mod for minecraft. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

It contains various things:
- Data generation.   (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/pak)
- Easy registering of anything that can be put into a registry.  (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/registration)
- A flexible widget system for guis.   (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/screen)
- A (mostly) automated system for synchronizing entity & blockentity data.   (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/content)
- A plethora of utility classes.   (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/util)
- Implemented item & fluid (broken currently) inventories.   (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/storage)
- EzPM (Easy Parameter Mapping), a JSON ripoff mainly designed for the data generation. Not to be confused with Easy Performance Monitoring. (Yes, I should probably rename it.)  (src/main/kotlin/talsumi/marderlib/easyparametermapping)
- Some other smaller things.

Feel free to use any part of this library in your own projects. If you copy an entire class/system, attribution would be appreciated.
